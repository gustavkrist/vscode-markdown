## R Markdown math highlighting and completion

Fork of Markdown All In One, but enables the extension to work
in R Markdown files. 
Provides syntax highlighting and code completion in inline and display
math blocks.
Inline math is contained within two `$`, math blocks
are between two pairs of `$$`.
Inline math highlighting only works while there are no spaces between the
math and the `$` on either end.

Example:

Math mode can be toggled with `cmd + m` on mac and 
`ctrl + m` on Windows.
